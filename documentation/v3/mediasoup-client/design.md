# mediasoup-client v3 Design

mediasoup-client is a JavaScript library for building mediasoup based client side applications (such as web applications). It's a tiny library exposing a powerful cross-browser API and supports all current WebRTC browsers via different [handlers](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup-client/tree/v3/src/handlers) for each model/version.


## Features

* ECMAScript low level API.
* Works in the browser and Node.js.

<div markdown="1" class="note">
There is no native WebRTC or RTP engine in Node.js. When running in Node.js the application must provide mediasoup-client with a custom [handler](/documentation/v3/mediasoup-client/api/#DeviceOptions) to control a 3rd party media/RTP library.
