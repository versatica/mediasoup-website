I'm passionate about new technologies, Open Source, WebRTC, modern Web development, Node.js, C++ and, above all, Real-Time Communications.

During the last years of my life I've been deeply involved in Voice over IP technologies, collaborating in many well known Open Source software projects and designing and implementing others of my own. I also have authored and co-authored some protocol specifications in the IETF, including the [RFC 7118][rfc7118-url]{:target="_blank"} "The WebSocket Protocol as a Transport for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" where my transition to WebRTC began.

Since the first days of WebRTC my professional efforts go around it, and this is where mediasoup takes place. Made with love, this is by far my largest Open Source project, combining several of my preferred technical fields plus so many sleepless nights coding and reading specifications.

I'm a Real Time Communication passionate and developer. For the last years I've been focused on WebRTC development. I'm core designer, developer and maintainer of mediasoup. I also have taken part in the specification of [Object RTC (ORTC) API for WebRTC][ortc-draft-url].

As a former VoIP engineer I have many years of experience in SIP and VoIP.

I'm a core author of [JsSIP][jssip-url] "The JavaScript SIP library" and co-author of the [RFC 7118][rfc7118-url]{:target="_blank"} "The WebSocket Protocol as a Transport for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)".
